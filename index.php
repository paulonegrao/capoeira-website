	<p>Borned and raised in Brazil, Capoeira is a cultural expression and a mix of martial art, coporal language and rythms. Characterized by their agile and harmonious movements, percusion instruments and achorbatic skills, the Capoeira practitioners use the movements of their entire body to atack and defend, in a dynamic kind of fighting & dancing performance inside the <em>roda</em>.</p>
	<p>The main instrument used in capoeira the is <em>berimbau</em>. It dictates the rhythm and the style of the game, giving a characteristic sound to the capoeira. The berimbau is basically made up of a piece of wire, a stick and a gourd. The rhythms can vary from slow, cadenced, and very fast beats.</p>
	<p><em>Ginga</em> is the movement of the whole body in a rhythmic way, keeping the body relaxed, shifting the center of gravity of the body constantly and keeping alert for dodge, attack and counterattack movements.

	There are several styles of capoeira, with 3 main ones:
